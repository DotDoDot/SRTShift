00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,177
In this lesson, we're going to
be talking about finance. And

2
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:07,009
one of the most important aspects
of finance is interest.

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,655
When I go to a bank or some
other lending institution

4
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:14,720
to borrow money, the bank is happy
to give me that money. But then I'm

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,480
going to be paying the bank for the
privilege of using their money. And that

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,440
amount of money that I pay the bank is
called interest. Likewise, if I put money

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,220
in a savings account or I purchase a
certificate of deposit, the bank just

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,800
doesn't put my money in a little box
and leave it there until later. They take

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,822
my money and lend it to someone
else. So they are using my money.

10
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:41,400
The bank has to pay me for the privilege
of using my money.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,700
Now what makes banks
profitable is the rate

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,330
that they charge people to use the bank's
money is higher than the rate that they

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:57,720
pay people like me to use my money. The
amount of interest that a person pays or

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,640
earns is dependent on three things. It's
dependent on how much money is involved.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,300
It's dependent upon the rate of interest
being paid or the rate of interest being

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,898
charged. And it's also dependent upon
how much time is involved. If I have

17
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:19,730
a loan and I want to decrease the amount
of interest that I'm going to pay, then

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,040
I'm either going to have to decrease how
much money I borrow, I'm going to have

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,420
to borrow the money over a shorter period
of time, or I'm going to have to find a

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,279
lending institution that charges a lower
interest rate. On the other hand, if I

21
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:38,480
want to earn more interest on my
investment, I'm going to have to invest

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,860
more money, leave the money in the
account for a longer period of time, or

23
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,970
find an institution that will pay
me a higher interest rate.
